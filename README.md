# twitchcore

A RISC-V core, first in Python, then in Verilog, then on FPGA.

# TODO

* Fix unaligned loads/stores (I think this is good now, at least acceptable)
* Make pipelining work
* Add M instructions for fast multiply and divide
* Add better introspection

# TODO (later)

* Many ROBs like M1 go very fast
